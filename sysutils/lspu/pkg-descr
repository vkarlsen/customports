lspu is a command-line FreeBSD utility to list running processes currently
using given binaries or shared libraries, because this information is not
available via fstat.
For example, it might help finding out how many processes will be affected
when upgrading a shared library.

Run it with full paths to binaries or shared libraries. For example,
lspu /lib/libc.so.7 will list pretty much every non-jailed running user
process.
One can also use procstat -va | grep /lib/libc.so.7, but procstat omits process
name/path.
Exit codes are
0 if no processes found,
1 on error of some sort,
2 if one or more processes are found.
