pfff is a set of tools and APIs to perform static analysis, code 
visualizations, code navigations, or style-preserving source-to-source 
transformations such as refactorings on source code. There is good support 
for C, Java, Javascript and PHP. There is also preliminary support for other 
languages such as C++, Rust, C#, Html, CSS, Erlang, Lisp, Haskell, Python, 
OPA and SQL. There is also very good support for OCaml code so that the 
framework can be used on the code of pfff itself.
