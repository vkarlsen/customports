A small collection of scripts for handling blacklists for Postfix:
- addspammer: add a spamming mail server to the blacklist
- maketraplist: get external lists and make postfix traplists of them
- fetchtraplist: rsync the traplists from other hosts

Please note that these scripts contain static values that are valid
for the environment they are intended for.
You will need to edit those to fit your needs.
