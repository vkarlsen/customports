Qt image plugin for HEIF images, wrapping libheif.
It enables existing Qt applications to open and save .heic files,
such as those from Apple devices.

Currently, support is limited to the following:

  - Basic reading and writing of the primary image
  - Reading of files with multiple top-level images
