Kakoune is a code editor heavily inspired by Vim, as such most of its commands
are similar to Vi's ones, and it shares Vi's "keystrokes as a text editing
language" model.

Kakoune can operate in two modes, normal and insertion. In insertion mode,
keys are directly inserted into the current buffer. In normal mode, keys are
used to manipulate the current selection and to enter insertion mode.

Kakoune has a strong focus on interactivity, most commands provide immediate
and incremental results, while still being competitive (as in keystroke count)
with Vim.

Kakoune works on selections, which are oriented, inclusive range of characters,
selections have an anchor and a cursor character. Most commands move both of
them, except when extending selection where the anchor character stays fixed 
and the cursor one moves around.
