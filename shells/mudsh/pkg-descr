A MUD based shell, rescued from the pages of time. The original hosting site, 
xirium.com, seems to be dead since ~2008.

Is there any reason why a shell (or command line) cannot be as tolerant or as
intelligent as a text adventure game like Zork, or a MUD [Multi User Dungeon]?
Is there any reason why a shell cannot work like such a game? ("Go North",
etc.) Actually, no and we have the implementation to prove it. Have fun, and 
don't get eaten by a Grue!
